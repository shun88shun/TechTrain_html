A tool that lets you easily manage git hooks

- Zero dependency
- Small configuration (1 object in package.json)
- Lightweight:

## Usage

### Add simple-git-hooks to the project

1. Install simple-git-hooks as a dev dependency:
   
   ```sh
   npm install simple-git-hooks --save-dev
   ```

2. Add `simple-git-hooks` to your `package.json`. Fill it with git hooks and the corresponding commands.

    For example:

    ```jsonc
    {
      "simple-git-hooks": {
        "pre-commit": "npx lint-staged",
        "pre-push": "cd ../../ && npm run format",

        // All unused hooks will be removed automatically by default
        // but you can use the `preserveUnused` option like following to prevent this behavior

        // if you'd prefer preserve all unused hooks
        "preserveUnused": true,

        // if you'd prefer preserve specific unused hooks
        "preserveUnused": ["commit-msg"]
      }
    }
    ```

    This configuration is going to run all linters on every `commit` and formatter on `push`.
    
3. Run the CLI script to update the git hooks with the commands from the config:

   ```sh
   npx simple-git-hooks
   ```
    
Now all the git hooks are created.
